abstract,abstract,we investigate the use of ground based gravitational wave interferometers for studies of the strong field domain of qed interferometric measurements of phase velocity shifts induced by quantum fluctuations in magnetic fields can become a sensitive probe for nonlinear self interactions among macroscopic electromagnetic fields we identify pulsed magnets as a suitable strong field source since their pulse frequency can be matched perfectly with the domain of highest sensitivity of gravitational wave interferometers if these interferometers reach their future sensitivity goals not only strong field qed phenomena can be discovered but also further parameter space of hypothetical hidden sector particles will be accessible

conclusion,conclusion,in this paper we proposed a new scenario of hybrid like inflation in remote inflation radiation raised continuously by a dissipating inflaton field causes symmetry restoration in a remote sector and the false vacuum energy of the remote sector dominates the energy density during inflation the situation is similar to hybrid inflation but the hybrid type potential is not required in this scenario remote inflation is terminated when the temperature reaches the critical temperature or when the slow roll condition is violated of course the scenario is identical to thermal inflation if the radiation is not supplied by the inflaton without introducing additional couplings the inflaton field may roll out like an inverted hybrid model or quintessential inflation significant signatures of remote inflation can be observed in the spectrum for a single field remote sector the difference is caused by the inhomogeneous phase transition in the remote sector for multi field extension of the remote sector successive phase transition is possible and it may cause significant difference in the spectrum remote inflation can predict strong amplification or suppression of small scale perturbations which may appear without introducing multiple inflation note that the phase transition in the remote sector is possible during standard warm inflaton irrespective of the domination by the false vacuum energy in the remote sector

introduction,introduction,the origin of geomagnetic reversals is a much debated subject among scientists in the fields of paleomagnetism and dynamo theory there is general agreement that a detailed understanding of reversals is a key issue of geodynamo theory in this connection also the problem of global excursions of the geomagnetic field in which the dipole strength reaches temporarily unusually low values has been discussed and it has been suggested citationelement citationelement see also citationelement and later papers by citationelement and citationelement that global excursions are aborted reversals not all recorded excursions are global ones but global excursions still appear to occur more frequently than reversals citationelement identified at least six global excursions in the last about NUM ky since the brunhes matuyama reversal but in the last decade many more global excursions have been found according to citationelement in this letter we wish to support the notion that global excursions and reversals originate from the same mechanism an oscillatory dynamo process that manifests itself primarily in the toroidal component of the magnetic field will be proposed as such a mechanism indeed from the perspective of the oscillations excursions must be considered as the normal behavior while a reversal represents an exceptional excursion in which the mean poloidal field is perturbed more strongly that it can recover from its low amplitude state only with the opposite sign

conclusion,abstract,opportunistic spatial orthogonalization oso is a novel cr scheme that allows the existence of secondary users even when the primary user occupies all the frequency bands all the time this scheme relies on the randomness and independence among channel matrices and exploits the spatial dimensions to orthogonalize users and hence minimize interference the oso scheme developed for simo has led to the interesting concept of opportunistic interference alignment for the mimo case it is shown that ill conditioned mimo channel significantly increases the total throughput without much sacrifice of pus performance

introduction,conclusion,we have seen that multiwrapped instanton contributions are quite generic in caligraphic_N RELOP_equals NUM and caligraphic_N RELOP_equals NUM non perturbative effects this may seem to lead to a potential puzzle in a different NUM caligraphic_N RELOP_equals NUM context in which the reduction from caligraphic_N RELOP_equals NUM is obtained by introducing NUM spacefilling d branes leading to NUM caligraphic_N RELOP_equals NUM gauge sectors in such models certain d brane instantons wrapped on the same internal cycles as the gauge d branes admit the interpretation of gauge theory instantons in many examples the non perturbative effects in NUM caligraphic_N RELOP_equals NUM gauge theories are ensured by r symmetry and holomorphy to arise only at the NUM instanton level in these models such macroscopic considerations forbid the contribution from multiwrapped instantons in this section we take a small detour to understand microscopically the absence of multiwrapped instantons emphasizing the key differences with previous systems where they are present
