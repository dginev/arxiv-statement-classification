abstract,abstract,theories of gravity invariant under those diffeomorphisms generated by transverse vectors are considered such theories are dubbed transverse and differ from general relativity in that the determinant of the metric is a transverse scalar we comment on diverse ways in which these models can be constrained using a variety of observations generically an additional scalar degree of freedom mediates the interaction so the usual constraints on scalar tensor theories have to be imposed if the purely gravitational part is einstein hilbert but the matter action is transverse the models predict that the three a priori different concepts of mass gravitational active and gravitational passive as well as inertial are not equivalent anymore these transverse deviations from general relativity are therefore tightly constrained actually correlated with existing bounds on violations of the equivalence principle local violations of newtons third law and or violation of local position invariance

introduction,introduction,the family of distributions proposed by birnbaum and saunders NUM also known as the fatigue life distribution has been widely applied for describing fatigue life and lifetimes in general this family of distributions was originally obtained from a model for which failure follows from the development and growth of a dominant crack it was later derived by desmond NUM using a biological model which followed from relaxing some of the assumptions originally made by birnbaum and saunders NUM

conclusion,abstract,non redundant aperture masking has established itself as a powerful and productive high angular resolution technique and is implemented on most major ground based observatories it was recently accepted as a late addition to jwsts fgs tfi there are good reasons detailed simulations with time varying mirror figure errors and existing data reduction methods suggest that non redundant aperture masks would benefit any of the jwst instruments bringing exciting high resolution high contrast imaging within reach in fact low cost minimal impact on hardware relaxed optical requirements and high scientific payoff recommend nrm as a leading technology for any future missions possessing a high angular resolution imaging component                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
conclusion,acknowledgement,during a pause of the meeting at ictp we were walking around the miramare campus at trieste and john told me giancarlo you know well how important i consider my interest in foundational problems however i must state that i think that to devote oneself exclusively to this kind of studies is a luxury one has also to do something more practical to get paid this is why at cern i am so involved in physics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
conclusion,definition,for nonzero elements and in the rational function has a position in each element of the quadratic tree we use the following terminology NUM has a zero at if the maximal ideal of NUM has a pole at if NUM is a unit at if both and NUM is undetermined at if both and it is clear that if has a zero or pole or is a unit at then has respectively a zero or pole or is a unit in each that dominates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
conclusion,example,let us now consider the evaluation of the constrained path integral ref the gauge field satisfies perfect conductor boundary conditions on the boundary and the exponent contains a chern simons term plus terms where the gauge field couples linearly to sources we will proceed to split in the measure into a classical part satisfying the proper boundary conditions plus a fluctuating field with trivial dirichlet boundary conditions such that vanishes on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
conclusion,introduction,that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating is now just over a decade after the first evidence from observations of type ia supernovae a firmly established aspect of cosmology the rapid progress in establishing this fact is a testament to the breathtaking convergence of techniques and technology that has emerged in observational cosmology in turn cosmic acceleration has introduced new wrinkles into almost every part of theoretical cosmology ranging from the details of structure formation through the cmb and gravitational lensing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
conclusion,proof,using the results of the precedent subsections we now aim at showing that as and we will proceed by induction for every consider the product then we make the following induction hypothesis for some we suppose otherwise ref is trivial we will show that it implies indeed we have if is not stable then by ref we have since in this case and by the induction hypothesis but in this case note that by construction we have so we obtain if is stable we have by ref which implies with the induction hypothesis but in this case we have by construction either or and this leads to as the induction hypothesis is verified for by ref we showed that for all we have as and now taking and using ref we obtain as and by lemma ref ref and ref we obtain that a s as together with ref the inequality ref proves theorem ref

conclusion,problem,these axiom schemata lead to many questions among them NUM are there models of or which are forcing extensions of NUM are there similar natural schemas making the universe large but contradicting or NUM what are the consequences for ordinary mathematics of these axioms

conclusion,remark,as it was mentioned in the introduction is the probability that individuals in the and species interbreed to produce an individual our assumption ref means that the parents independently participate for producing under this condition the qso became a product of two linear operators note that volterra qso citationelement also is product of two linear operators identical operator and a linear operator the theory of the volterra qsos is developed enough but our sqso corresponding to quadratic matrices and coincides with volterra qso iff or is the identical matrix thus one can expect that sqsos may have different dynamical behavior we already have seen that sqsos for example ref may have periodic trajectories this is quite different behavior from the behavior of the volterra qso since volterra operators have no periodic trajectories we described a wide family of linear lyapunov functions for sqsos but for volterra qsos such a family of functions is not described except which is constructed in citationelement under some conditions on parameters of ref by using theory of tournaments we think our argument also works for volterra qsos to describe linear lyapunov functions

introduction,abstract,the ads cft correspondence identifies asymptotically gravitational dynamics with the master field evolution of large field theories in particular it relates the evolution of spacetimes with horizons to the non equilibrium statistical dynamics of the high temperature phase of the dual field theory this connection has recently been studied in detail in a near equilibrium limit it has been established that the spacetimes that locally i e tube wise approximate the black brane metric obey the equations of boundary fluid dynamics with gravitationally determined dissipative constants the equations of fluid dynamics are thus embedded in a long distance sector of asymptotically gravity a fascinating connection that promises to prove useful in many ways

introduction,conclusion,at first glance it should not be difficult to extract the astrometric signal of an earth like planet from the composite signal of a system of planets around a star because each planet has its own frequency in time so in a fourier analysis of the total signal the signature of any given planet should stand out compared to any other planet however in reality the case might be not so simple because for example a planet in an eccentric orbit with a dominating signal e g a jupiter might have harmonic terms that are not recognized as such but might look like a separate planet or a long period planet observed over a time shorter than that period would have noise generated at many frequencies owing to the difficulty of distinguishing a proper motion on the sky from a part of an orbit for these reasons plus the fact that a mission should always be simulated before it is flown we initiated a double blind simulation to see how well earth like planets i e terrestrial masses habitable zone periods in multi planet systems could be detected with sim lite with the help of radial velocity rv data an additional goal was to see what accuracy of sim lite is needed to detect earth like planets

introduction,example,in this section we consider reducing to NUM by an orientifold quotient the main effect of such orientifolds is that they can project out certain fermion zero modes of d brane instantons allowing them to contribute to the superpotential for instance for d1 brane instantons this would correspond to wrapping them on holomorphic curves of topology clearly a systematic computation of such NUM superpotentials would require a formulation of topological string in orientifold models dubbed real topological string recent progress in this field see e g citationelement holds the promise of such applications although the connection of the real topological strings to the physical orientifold theories is not fully understood however the existence of a gv interpretation for real topological string amplitudes almost guarantees the applicability of some lessons to here we show that the particular lesson of relating d brane instantons to d brane particle loops by t duality and threshold bound states to multi instanton processes survives in orientifold theories and explains the continuity of non perturbative superpotentials through threshold walls this should be related to the continuity of unoriented gv invariants for the real topological string

proof,example,the triangle in figure ref has vertices and and so is not smooth the points inside the triangles and can be displaced by probes in the directions and all but a short segment of can be displaced by vertical probes from it is easy to check that this is the most one can displace by probes starting on or on the other hand the best probes from are either parallel to in the direction or are parallel to in the direction in fact the latter set of probes displaces no new points therefore this triangle contains an open region that cannot be reached by probes

result,related work,the netflix prize competition citationelement has recently generated increased interest in recommender algorithms in the research community and put recommender algorithms under a systematic thorough evaluation on standard data citationelement the final best results blended a very large number of methods whose reproduction is out of the scope of this paper as one of our baselines we selected a successful matrix factorization recommender described by simon funk in citationelement that is based on an approach reminiscent of gradient boosting citationelement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
result,remark,motivated by these lines of work in additive number theory and hardness of approximation we wish to obtain weaker conditions that guarantee ref indeed our main result theorem ref shows that for some constant which only depends on the pairwise independent distribution where denotes the size of the largest fourier coefficient of is pairwise independent as in figure ref the functions are of fourier degree at most in other words all of their fourier coefficients at levels above are
